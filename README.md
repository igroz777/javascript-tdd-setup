###Overview
This module exposes a simple function, sumOfPrimes(), that returns the sum of all the prime numbers from 0 to a given number n.

###Spec
The sumOfPrimes function will return the sum of all prime numbers between 0 and n(not including n).
E.g. sumOfPrimes(10) should return 15 as the sum of primes numbers between 0 and 10 is 15 (3 + 5 + 7 == 15).
An invalid input for n such as a negative number, array, string or any other input except a non-negative intiger or float number will return -1.
